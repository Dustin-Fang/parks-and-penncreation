### Installing Dependencies

This project relies on React, NodeJS, express, jest, and MongoDB! Within each file, the list of dependencies are stored within the package.json files. All put together, this list of dependencies includes:

    "node-fetch": "^3.2.3",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.15",
    "supertest": "^6.2.2",
    "@chakra-ui/icons": "^1.1.7",

    "react-router-dom": "^5.3.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  }
  
  Because we style our code with eslint, we also have the following developer depenedencies:
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.14.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.29.4"
  }

### Instructions for Building Locally

* To execute the overall program / application, download this github repo, and cd into both the client and server folders
* In each file, run npm install to install all node package manager files (and node_modules). After this, run both the client and server on two separate terminals through the command npm start
* Open the react app client side, and the application is ready to use!
* Note: running npm install may take a couple of minutes
